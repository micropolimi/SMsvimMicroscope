Application for Spatially Modulated Selective Volume Illumination Microscopy using:
    Hamamatsu Flash 4.0 Camera
    PI C413 Voice coil motor
    DMD Texas Instrument DLP-6500
The software for these devices can be found in their relative repositories.   

See Calisesi et al. "Spatially modulated illumination allows for light sheet fluorescence microscopy with an incoherent source and compressive sensing" Biomedical Optics Express 2019 for details on the technique.
